# NixOS Cloud Administration
## Overview
This repository contains configuration files and scripts designed to leverage NixOS for managing a secure and resilient virtual cloud computing and network environment. It includes localised networking facilities, comprehensive virtualisation support, and robust cybersecurity measures. The collaborative administration of this environment is enabled through the carefully configured NixOS, which allows team members with distinct roles to efficiently manage cloud resources, configure and maintain services, and oversee the infrastructure in a secure and coordinated manner.

Cybersecurity is a central focus, with configurations and practices aimed at protecting the environment from potential threats. These include implementing strict access controls, encryption, regular security audits, and automated monitoring to detect and respond to vulnerabilities in real-time. By integrating these configurations, the repository ensures that your virtualised network environment is not only robust and scalable but also adheres to the highest standards of security, safeguarding both cloud-based and on-premise resources.
