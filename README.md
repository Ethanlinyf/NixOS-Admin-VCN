# NixOS Cloud Administration
## Overview
This repository contains configuration files and scripts designed to leverage NixOS for managing a secure and resilient virtual cloud computing and network environment. It includes localised networking facilities, comprehensive virtualisation support, and robust cybersecurity measures. The collaborative administration of this environment is enabled through the carefully configured NixOS, which allows team members with distinct roles to efficiently manage cloud resources, configure and maintain services, and oversee the infrastructure in a secure and coordinated manner.

Cybersecurity is a central focus, with configurations and practices aimed at protecting the environment from potential threats. These include implementing strict access controls, encryption, regular security audits, and automated monitoring to detect and respond to vulnerabilities in real-time. By integrating these configurations, the repository ensures that your virtualised network environment is not only robust and scalable but also adheres to the highest standards of security, safeguarding both cloud-based and on-premise resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First thing first, ensure the following installed:

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) - The Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control system for managing code.
- [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) - For secure communication between machines.
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - For Infrastructure as Code (optional).
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - For configuration management (optional).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Ethanlinyf/NixOS-Admin-VCN.git
   cd nixos-cloud-admin
   ```

2. **Set Up NixOS**

   Follow the instructions in the NixOS Installation Guide to set up NixOS on your server or virtual machine.

3. **Configure NixOS**

   Customize the configuration files in this repository according to your cloud environment and team roles. Start by modifying the `configuration.nix` file.

   ```
   sudo cp -r ./nixos-config/* /etc/nixos/
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

## Roles and Responsibilities

This project is organized to support the following roles:

- **System Administrator**: Manages NixOS system configurations, services, and security.
- **Cloud Engineer**: Manages cloud infrastructure using Terraform, cloud CLI tools, and other automation scripts.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Maintains CI/CD pipelines, automates deployments, and manages configuration management using Ansible.
- **Network Administrator**: Oversees network configurations, firewall rules, and VPN setups.
- **Security Officer**: Ensures the security of the NixOS system, manages access controls, and monitors compliance.

## Usage Instructions

### Deploying NixOS Configurations

To deploy configurations on your NixOS system, use the following commands:

```
# Deploy the entire configuration
sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# Deploy a specific module
sudo nixos-rebuild switch -I nixos-config=/path/to/module.nix
```

### Managing Cloud Infrastructure

For cloud engineers, use the provided Terraform configurations and cloud CLI tools:

```
# Initialize Terraform
cd terraform/
terraform init

# Apply Terraform configuration
terraform apply
```

### Running Ansible Playbooks

DevOps engineers can run Ansible playbooks from the `ansible/` directory:

```
cd ansible/
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml site.yml
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline automatically tests and deploys changes to the NixOS configurations.

### Triggering the Pipeline

- **Push to `main`**: Triggers a full deployment.
- **Pull Request**: Triggers testing and code review checks.

Check the `.github/workflows/` directory for more details.

## Best Practices

- **Use Branches**: Create feature branches for all changes and submit pull requests for review.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **Code Reviews**: Ensure all pull requests are reviewed by relevant team members.
- **Documentation**: Keep all documentation up to date with any changes.
